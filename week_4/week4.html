    <h2>Week 4: Analytics of Encoded Notation</h2>  
  <p> The first part of this weeks activity was to generate a jSymbolic analysis of my chosen piece, Sonata by Paul Dukas. 
    I selected what I thought would be the most relevant features and this can be accessed <a href="sonata-pauldukas-features.csv">here</a></p>

  <p> The second part of this weeks activity was to use the Python notebook to generate a piano roll and pitch histogram of my piece using music21.
    These figures are shown below. </p>
