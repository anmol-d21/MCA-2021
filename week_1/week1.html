  <h1> Week 1 Lab Task</h1>
  
  
<p> The theme for my dataset is the French composer Paul Dukas. Paul Dukas was known for his orchestral piece 'L'apprenti sorcier', with other works including 'Sonata in E-flat minor', 'Symphony in C' etc. His compositions were influenced by composers such as Beethoven, Berlioz, Franck, d'Indy and Debussy. He was very critical of his work and destroyed many of his projects. 
  This in particular interested me to choose him as my theme since I wanted to learn more about the pieces he decided to keep.
  
  Descriptive data: On IMSLP, descriptive data about each piece of music is shown at the bottom of the screen. For example it describes when the piece was composed, how many movements there are within it, the average duration of the piece and so on. 
  The individual sections also have more data relating to who created the score/who performed the track. An exmaple can be seen below. I think there should be more though.
  
  Notated data: Almost all of his pieces are available via manuscript or computerised form. Websites such as IMSLP however it is also available to purchase from

Acoustic Data: Paul Dukas' works are easily accessible to listen to via streaming sites such as Spotify, as well as websites like IMSLP..</p>
