  <p>Add images From the similarity matrix we can see my chosen tracks are clusted near the other ‘classical’ tracks. 
	  This makes sense as Paul Dukas is a classical composer.
	 A lot of the track has been distorted. For example, the tempo has changed drastically, loads of the notes are different as well as the grace notes and articulations. 
	  It has kept the same time signature but deleted all the text surrounding the staves.</p>
